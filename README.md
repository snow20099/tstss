# Nurex - Minecraft Website Template

### Thank you for downloading my website template!

To get **started** do the following steps...

1. Install Nodejs v20 or v20+.
2. Enter in the mc-web directory and run `npm i --force` (Press enter for any prompts).
3. Edit the fields in the `.env` accordingly such as you're server name and server ip.
4. When everything is done, run `npm run start` and visit localhost:3000.
5. And you are all set!
6. (Optional) If you want html version of the site, run `npm run build`. Note that you wont be able to edit the content of the website in the build version!
